The owner of a Compressed NFT can delegate it to another account whilst keeping ownership of the cNFT. {% .lead %}

This allows the delegated account — which we also refer to as the **Delegate Authority** — to perform actions on behalf of the owner. These actions are:

- [Transferring the cNFT](/bubblegum/transfer-cnfts).
- [Burning the cNFT](/bubblegum/burn-cnfts).

Each of these actions provide examples on how to use the **Delegate Authority** to perform them, but usually, it is simply the case of providing the **Leaf Delegate** account as a Signer instead of passing the **Leaf Owner** account as a Signer.

Let's see how we can approve and revoke Delegate Authorities for our Compressed NFTs.
