If you are a Rust developer, you can also use a Rust crate to interact with the Token Metadata program. Since the program is written in Rust, this crate contains all the program's logic, including helper methods that prepare instructions for us.

This can be helpful if you are developing a Rust client or if you want to make [CPI calls](https://solanacookbook.com/references/programs.html#how-to-do-cross-program-invocation) to the Token Metadata program within your program.
