## Introduction

Whilst all of Metaplex's products offer clients that include all you need to get started with that particular product, they do not include clients for low-level yet essentials tasks such as creating an account from the SPL System program or extending a Lookup Table from the SPL Address Lookup Table program. MPL Toolbox aims to fix this by offering a collection of essential Solana and Metaplex programs that can be used to perform these more low-level tasks. Namely, MPL Toolbox includes the following programs:

- [SPL System](#spl-system). The native Solana program that allows us to create accounts.
- [SPL Token and SPL Associated Token](#spl-token-and-spl-associated-token). The native Solana programs that allow us to manage tokens.
- [SPL Memo](#spl-memo). The native Solana program that allows us to attach memos to transactions.
- [SPL Address Lookup Table](#spl-address-lookup-table). The native Solana program that allows us to manage lookup tables.
- [MPL System Extras](#mpl-system-extras). An immutable Metaplex program that allows us to create accounts without needing to fetch the rent exemption.
- [MPL Token Extras](#mpl-token-extras). An immutable Metaplex program that offers a few extra low-level features on top of SPL Token.
